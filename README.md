# Responsive Club Website Project

## Project Goals
This was a challenge project from Codecademy's Front-End Engineer path in the "Making a Website Responsive" module. Its goal is to build a club group page that dynamically responds to different screen sizes using flexbox and grid.  
On top of using the flexbox and grid system in CSS, this website also uses media queries to adjust the display for different screen sizes.

Rendering a different page for the mobile user (such as m.example.com) by detecting the user agent will also add more work for maintenance. Making a page using flexbox, grid, and media queries is easier to maintain.

## Tools
+ HTML
+ CSS
  + relative units
  + grid

  + media queries
